# MUGE Text To Image Generation Baseline

## Requirements and Installation
More details see [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq). Briefly,

* python == 3.6.4
* pytorch == 1.7.1

1. **Installing fairseq and other requirements**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MUGE-2021/image-caption-baseline
cd muge_baseline/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd fairseq/
pip install --editable .
```

2. **Downloading data and place to `dataset/` directory,**
    file structure is 
```markdown
text2image-baseline
    - dataset
        - ECommerce-T2I
            - T2I_train.img.tsv
            - T2I_train.text.tsv
            - ...
``` 

## Getting Started
The model is a BART-like model with vqgan as a image tokenizer, please see `models/t2i_baseline.py` for detailed model structure.
### Training 
```bash
cd run_scripts/; bash train_t2i_vqgan.sh
```
Model training takes about 5 hours.

### Inference
```bash
cd run_scripts/; bash generate_t2i_vqgan.sh
```
See results in `results/` directory.
